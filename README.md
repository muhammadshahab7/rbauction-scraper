## 📌 Overview

This project provides a **powerful and flexible scraper** for extracting product details from [Ritchie Bros Auction (rbauction.com)](https://www.rbauction.com), a global auction site for heavy equipment and trucks.

- 🦾 `Selenium` – Reliable for JavaScript-rendered content

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Extract product **title**, **features**, and **images**
- ✅ Smart image filtering (cdn / www-ironplanet based)
- ✅ Works on dynamic & static content
- ✅ Modular & customizable for batch scraping

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### 📦 Dependencies

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium
```

### ✅ ChromeDriver for Selenium

Make sure you have the ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome version.  
Download: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

---

## 💻 Usage

### 1. 🔎 BeautifulSoup (Static Scraping)

```bash
python beautifulsoup_scraper.py
```

> ⚠️ Use only if product content is visible in raw HTML source.

---

### 2. 🦿 Selenium (Dynamic Scraping)

```bash
python selenium_scraper.py
```

> Uses `headless Chrome` to render and extract content.  
> Suitable for most cases where JS is required to load product details.

## 📸 Output Example

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.rbauction.com/xyz123",
  "title": "2022 CAT 320 GC Track Excavator",
  "feature": "Air Conditioner, Boom Check Valve, 24 in Triple Grouser Track Shoes",
  "images": [
    "https://cdn.ironpla.net/image1.jpg",
    "https://www-ironplanet.com/image2.jpg"
  ]
}
```

---

## 🎯 Domain Filtering Logic

To avoid unrelated or low-resolution images, the scraper **only includes image URLs** that start with:

- `https://www-ironplanet`
- `https://cdn.ironpla.net`

This ensures high-quality, relevant images only.
