## üì∏ Output Example

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.rbauction.com/xyz123",
  "title": "2022 CAT 320 GC Track Excavator",
  "feature": "Air Conditioner, Boom Check Valve, 24 in Triple Grouser Track Shoes",
  "images": [
    "https://cdn.ironpla.net/image1.jpg",
    "https://www-ironplanet.com/image2.jpg"
  ]
}
```

---

## üéØ Domain Filtering Logic

To avoid unrelated or low-resolution images, the scraper **only includes image URLs** that start with:

- `https://www-ironplanet`
- `https://cdn.ironpla.net`

This ensures high-quality, relevant images only.
